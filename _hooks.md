## What are hooks?

Hooks are special functions, that allow us to use state and other React features in functional components.

Earlier, when we used to create React app using functional components, then we didn't have access to the state management and lifecycle methods. To access these features, we had to add class components.

So, this was a problem with functional components.

But, after the introduction of React hooks from version 16.8, we can now use state management and other react features without writing class components.

In other words, hooks are the fnctions that make functional components work like class components.

React hooks simplify the code, improves the readability, reusability, and overall performance of the application.

## useState

useState is a React hook which creates a 'state variable'. It helps us to track state in a component & updates the user interface when state changes.
